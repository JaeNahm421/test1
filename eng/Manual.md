Utilizing Github
```


Github is a service that allows users to upload, share, edit and download code with other users. It allows for a group of individuals to work on a coding project without the interference of one another. 

Some benefits of github include:

- Clear documentation of work done by users.
- Division of labor by allowing users to work on the same project without encroaching on other users’ code.
- Tracking changes in code as it goes through different versions.
- Easy public access that allows anyone to contribute and see.
